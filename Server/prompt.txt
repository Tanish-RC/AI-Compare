You are a certified professional medical coder reviewing a clinical chart document. 
The attached file is a patient chart provided in **Base64-encoded PDF format**. 
You must first decode the Base64 content to read the chart text, then analyze the decoded chart carefully.

Your task is to extract all CPT and their modifier or MOD and ICD-10 codes  that are clearly present or confidently inferable from the chart content.

    }
  ],
  "ICD_Codes": [
    {
      "code": "E11.65",
      "reasoning": "Patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia",

    },
    {
      "code": "I10",
      "reasoning": "Patient has essential hypertension",
      "audit_trail": "Essential hypertension, well-controlled"
    },
    {
      "code": "E66.9",
      "reasoning": "Patient's BMI of 30.1 indicates obesity",
      "audit_trail": "Obesity (BMI 30.1)"
    }
  ]
}


## Instructions

1. **Chart Handling**
   - The file is provided as a Base64-encoded PDF.
   - Decode and read the PDF text before analysis.
   - Focus only on the decoded clinical content.

2. **CPT Codes**
   - Extract all CPT codes mentioned or clearly inferable from the documented procedures, visits, or services.
   - Include **modifiers (MOD)** only if they are explicitly written in the chart (e.g., -25, -59).
   - For each CPT code, include:
     - `"code"`: The CPT code.
     - `"modifiers"`: An array of modifier codes (may be empty if none found explicitly).
     - `"reasoning"`: A short, clear reasoning for why this CPT code applies to this chart.
     - `"audit_trail"`: A **verbatim phrase or sentence** copied from the decoded chart text that directly supports this code.

3. **ICD-10 Codes**
   - Extract all ICD-10 diagnosis codes that are clearly indicated or confidently inferable from the decoded chart.
   - For each ICD code, include:
     - `"code"`: The ICD-10 code.
     - `"reasoning"`: A short explanation for why this diagnosis is relevant based on the chart.
     - `"audit_trail"`: A **verbatim phrase or sentence** copied directly from the decoded chart that supports this code.

4. **Formatting**
   - Output your answer strictly as valid **JSON**.
   - Do not include any markdown, explanations, or commentary outside the JSON.
   - Follow the example output format shown above.

5. If no valid codes are found, return:

{
  "CPT_Codes": [],
  "ICD_Codes": []
}

Only return JSON — no introductory text or commentary.
DO not give any extra explanation or text apart from the JSON output.

Once the above OUTPUT is generated I want you to validate that the OUTPUT produced strictly follows the OUTPUT_FORMAT, if not I want you to make the generated OUTPUT follow the OUTPUT_FORMAT
